Rice Leaf Lesions Detection Using Computer Vision

Agriculture is very important for a country like India where it 
contributes up to 16% to the national GDP, 82% of the farmers 
are small and marginal, and their problems rise as irrigating 
the fields is becoming tougher day by day because of the varied 
rainfall patterns. Due to improper irrigation, rice crops that 
require an extensive waterlogged land area for long periods of 
the day have begun to get infected by different types of diseases 
that are having a severe effect on the country's agrarian sector 
output. As paddy is widely consumed which makes it an important 
crop but it doesnâ€™t remove the likelihood of it being very fragile 
and susceptible to diseases. Rice is one of the most harmed and 
wasted crop according to UN crop health reports, among the many 
we have tried to concentrate over three majorly found diseases and 
then aimed to provide solution for these and then develop over the 
solution for other thousands of different trivial rice plant diseases. 
So we have come forward to solve this issue by informing the farmers 
much early about their crops being at risk through a web application 
that can diagnose the rice plant remotely and instantly. At first, 
proper disease detection is necessary to properly diagnose it. 
Due to limited data available online we decided to create our own 
smaller dataset from eclectic sources. In this paper, we present a 
self-designed algorithm that will detect the disease of rice crops 
based on four major disease classes. Our model is a hybrid of the 
EffientNetB5 model designed for smooth implementation on web applications. 
We will also compare it with other existing methodologies such as the 
VGG16 architecture model. We proposed a deep learning hybrid model that 
was trained over selected images of the diseases gathered from standard 
datasets of Kaggle and few from Google Images. After which training 
was done for few hours. Training required the use of frameworks such 
as Keras and TensorFlow for the machine learning part. 
This trained model was deployed on a web application interface developed 
by the team from scratch. . The application used our hybrid model that 
will really reduce the load of servers and resulted into very quick 
analysis of the images using the machine learning model in the backend.
